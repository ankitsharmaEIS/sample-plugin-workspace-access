# sample-plugin-workspace-access
Sample Maven-based workspace access plugin.

This sample plugin implements the plugin extension API: 

            ro.sync.exml.plugin.workspace.WorkspaceAccessPluginExtension
            
You can use "mvn install" to create a JAR containing the plugin folder. 
The JAR can later be expanded in the "OXYGEN_INSTALL_DIR/plugins" folder.
